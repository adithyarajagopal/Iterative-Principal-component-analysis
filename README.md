# Iterative-Principal-component-analysis
An iterative version of Principal component analysis derived using MLE of Multivariate Gaussian implemented using Python for an errors in variables model

This is a part of my summer research internship at IIT Madras in the field of Statistical ML
Further exlpained in my resume

I have further incorporated outlier detection in the model using hypothesis testing as well -- Chisquared test
